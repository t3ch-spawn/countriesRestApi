# Country Information App

## About
This is a website which displays the list of countries in the world, by using data from the countries rest api. It has a search functionality and filter by region functionality
Information about each country can be viewed when the corresponding card is clicked

## Technologies
I used React to build this application, along with Rive, for the loader and ligh/dark icon animations. 
I also used gsap and framer motion for the page transitions
And for styling, I used Tailwind Css
